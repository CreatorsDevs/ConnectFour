# Connect Four Game

## Description

Connect Four is a classic two-player board game implemented in C++ and played in the console. The objective of the game is to connect four discs of the same color (Red and Blue) either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on a 6x7 grid. Players take turns to drop their colored discs into the columns from the top, and the game continues until one player wins or the board is full (tie).

This project demonstrates C++ programming concepts such as functions, data structures, user input handling, loops, conditional statements, and console output formatting.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/CreatorsDevs/ConnectFour.git
```

2. Ensure you have a C++ 98 or above compiler installed on your system.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

4. Compile the "main.cpp" file using your C++ compiler. For example using G++ compiler:  

Windows: 
```
g++ main.cpp -o connect_four.exe
``` 
Linux: 
```
g++ main.cpp -o connect_four
``` 

5. Run the compiled executable to start the game.  

Windows:
```
connect_four.exe
```
Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS): 
```
./connect_four
```

6. Follow the on-screen instructions to play. Players will be prompted to enter the column number (1-7) where they want to drop their disc.

7. The game will display the board after each move, and it will announce the winner or declare a tie when the game ends.

8. After the game ends, you will be asked if you want to play again. Enter 'y' for yes or 'n' for no.
